## Nyrki√∂ is an open source platform for analysing performance test results and detecting changes

- Submit results using a REST API
- Uses change point detection to find performance regressions and improvements in noisy data
- Integrates with GitHub to identify the git commit that caused a change in performance

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions! The frontend is implemented using React and the backend is built on top of FastAPI and Pydantic.

If you want to hack on the frontend you can run `npm` directly from inside of the `frontend` directory.

```console
npm run dev
```

You can run a more realistic environment using the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file which will start services for the proxy (`nginx`), the frontend (`React`Single-page app) and the backend (`FastAPI` app).

```console
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
