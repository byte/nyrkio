async def precompute_cached_change_points():
    """
    When new test results are POSTed (to /result/test_name_path) we immediately calculate and cache
    the change points for that test. However, the pre_computed change points can become invalidated
    for various reasons, for example if the user changes the algorithm parameters in UserSettings.
    When that happens, this function will find and recompute the change points.

    Thanks to this function, change points should almost always be ready and returned fast when a
    user is viewing a dashboard or otherwise issuing a GET.

    Also, the /results/test_name/summary end point may cause a re-compute of change points for all
    of your test result data, which can take minutes but more importantly will consume all memory
    and OOM. A goal of this background task is to compute the change points in smaller chunks so that
    won't happen.
