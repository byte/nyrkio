              <p>Henrik has worked two decades in the world of Open Source databases: MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Postgresql...
              He is known for his interest in performance and scaling, including topics like distributed consensus algorithms.</p>
              <p>He has worked both in sales and engineering and both as a manager and engineer, giving him a broad experience that
              is helpful as an entrepreneur gets to do a little bit of everything.</p>
              <p>Henrik worked on the MongoDB performance engineering team in 2015, where the E-Divisive algorithm was first used
              for automating the detection of performance regressions, and eventually published as both a conference paper and
              open source code. Later he managed the performance team at Datastax, where further improvements were implemented
              and again open sourced. Now Nyrki√∂ is bringing that work into the mainstream.</p>
